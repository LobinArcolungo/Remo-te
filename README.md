# Remo-te


## Remo-te?
YES! This project aims to build an automated machine for tea brewing!<br>
Imagine jumping into your car after work and having to drive for quite some time. Wouldn't be great if once you get home a hot cup of freshly brewed tea is waiting for you just at the perfect temperature for you to not burn your tongue? And what if this was just a tap away from your finger?
<br>
<br>
Now that's what we are talking about! and you ca find beelow all the documentation that i wrote during the process of making this machine. Take it not as a tutorial but more as an inspiration for your very own version.<br>

## Materials
### for the electronic part we will need
- Arduino nano for debugging
- ESP 8266 or Arduino nano IoT for cloud connection
- 2 relays 5Vdc 10A
- 2 Micro Servo 9g MS18
- one L298N stepper motor module
- Power supply 12v 3A
- A generic 12V pump
- A stepper motor 17OM-J349-G2VS Minabea Motor
- A Breadboard to hold all the components

  
### for the mechanical part we will need
- To print all the .stl files in the "prints" folder
- A water tank to hold the water
- An electrical boiler with auto-shut-off function when boiling point is reached
- A plastic pulley
- A box to hold the circuitry
- A thick piece of twine
- (optional) A bearing to make the twine flow easily

## Circuit
In the folder "circuit" can be seen the history of the circuits. The last version is this one
