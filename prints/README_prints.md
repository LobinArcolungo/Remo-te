# Description of the files:

'remo_te_boiler.stl' and 'remo_te_dock.stl' are the main pieces which do most of the job of pouring without making the boiler spilling the water.

'bearing_housing.stl' is the piece who holds the bearing and helps the flowing of the rope decreasind the friction. I designed it starting from the file 'lagerhuis_kogellager.STL' from Hondjog1 downloaded from thingiverse at link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4111647


Feel free to download and modify any of these pieces, expecially because you must modify the remo_te_boiler.stl accordingly to your specific type of boiler
